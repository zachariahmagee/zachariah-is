        The Serial Plotter is a multi-platform desktop application designed for visualizing data over serial connections.
        It supports a variety of plot types, including Cartesian, Polar, and Scatter, along with multiple plotting modes and display effects.
        Users have fine-grained control over every aspect of the plotâ€” from axis ranges and labeling to colors and more.
        Configuration is flexible, with options to adjust settings through the user interface or via serial commands.
