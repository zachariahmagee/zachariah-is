## Let's talk about configuration

I figure a good way to start this blog off is to jump right in and discuss the details of my workflow.

Lets start with **hardware**:

Over the course of the last two years my setup evolved from an coffeeshop hopping with an old intel macbook with basically zero customization or personalization aside from a my own desktop wallpaper. I didn't use keyboard shortcuts, I'd never touched vim before and had no idea what a terminal multiplexor was or why anyone might need one. 

I still have that laptop but primarily work on an M2 Mac Mini running Sequoia. I started out with a crappy 24" Dell monitor I'd gotten from the thrift store and slowly but surely built an environment that encourages productivity. At the time I was developing a graphically intense desktop application for live data visualization. We needed to be able to test the app running fullscreen in 4K - so my work was kind enough to purchase a 34" curved ultra-wide. For a time I turned the 24" sideways and used it as a second monitor, for PDFs and documentation, but the difference in visual quality was beyond noticeable. I upgraded to a newer 27" vertical Dell that blows it's predecessor out of the water. I got a desk mount and put the vertical smaller monitor on the left, and the larger horizontal monitor in the center. 

One of the first purchases I bought for myself after aquiring my job was the [ZSA Moonlander](https://www.zsa.io/moonlander) split keyboard. For a few months it sat on my desk collecting dust as I continued to mash the keys of my macbook, ignorant of all the possibilities. But once I had the proper monitor set up, the mac mini, and the willingness to learn I was blown away. Customizing the keyboard was the door opening into a new way of working - of noticing my common workflows, what took my hands off of the keyboard, what could I automate or transform into a keyboard motion instead of a trackpad motion.

I think it is important to take a moment to discuss the work I was doing at the time and how that affected my push into a more customized workflow.
